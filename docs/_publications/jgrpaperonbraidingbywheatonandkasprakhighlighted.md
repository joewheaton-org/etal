An article by ET-AL members Joe Wheaton and [Alan Kasprak](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/alan-kasprak) and colleagues in the UK and Spain was just [published online in the Journal of Geophyscial Research - Earth Surface](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrf.20060/abstract). The article provides some of the first empirical field tests of classic braiding mechanisms. The article has been highlighted by AGU in their [Journal Highlights](http://www.agu.org/news/press/jhighlight_archives/2013/2013-05-07.shtml#five) and appeared in a 'Resesarch Spotlight' in EOS by Balcerak (2013) in June. See [here for a press release from USU](http://www.usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=52463) or [here for a press release](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/geography/news/2013/05/22_braided_rivers_key_paper.page?) from coauthors at the University of Southampton.
