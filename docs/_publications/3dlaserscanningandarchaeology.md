The Utah State University Archeological Services enlisted the use of the ETAL lab Leica Scan Station 2 terrestrial laser scanner to create a digital model and high resolution photography of historic sand cliff inscriptions in Southern Utah and to explore scan data manipulation and visualization to aid in identifying inscriptions not readily apparent. This publication will appear in the 2013 issue of Utah Archaeology.
