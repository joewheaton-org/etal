[Phaedra Budy](http://www.usu.edu/fel/members/), [Mary Conner,](http://www.cnr.usu.edu/wats/htm/faculty-staff/memberID=9448) and [Nira Salant](https://sites.google.com/a/salant.org/nsalant/) recently completed an effort in collaboration with the FHC's [Wally MacFarlane](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/Wally) to quantify the occupancy, extinction, and colonization of the endangered and threatened "big three" fish species at locations within the Colorado River Basin, USA. This contribution examines how hydrologic and landscape variability influence populations of bluehead sucker, roundtail chub, and flannelmouth sucker across space and time. [The effort was published in Conservation Biology and is in press now.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12513/abstract)

Congratulations to Phaedra, Mary, Nira and Wally on their contribution to the understanding and conservation of these desert fishes.
