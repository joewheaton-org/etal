The capacity model from the [Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool](http://brat.joewheaton.org/) (BRAT) was finally published as part of an invited contribution for a special issue in Geomorphology associated with the [2016 Bingahmton Geomorphology Symposium](https://conferencereg.colostate.edu/Registration/Welcome.aspx?e=F0EE8F51C612D9BD4EFEAC22BBD6D346).

This paper lays out the rationale for the capacity model and presents results from the Utah BRAT run as context.
