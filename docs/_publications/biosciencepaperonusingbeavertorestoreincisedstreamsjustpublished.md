Nick Bouwes and Joe Wheaton were co-authors with Michael Pollock and others on a paper that was just published in Bioscience that lays the conceptual framework for using beaver to restore incised streams. The conceptual framework is based on the group's experience in Bridge Creek, Oregon using beaver dams to restore an incised and degraded stream to the benefit of the steelhead.
