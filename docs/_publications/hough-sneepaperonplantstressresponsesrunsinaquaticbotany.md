One of my master's projects detailing the differences between *Carex* life history strategies was recently published as the lead-off in the January issue of [Aquatic Botany](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/aquatic-botany/). This paper compared two common wetland indicator species, *Carex obnupta*, an evergreen, hydrophytic sedge, and *Carex stipata*, a deciduous, hydrophytic sedge, to see how fertilization and flooding shaped each species' growth and biomass allocation. This paper has implications for explaining both species' life history strategies, and also for selecting and installing both species in created or restored wetlands.

I published this with, former [UW  SEFS](http://sefs.washington.edu/) grad student and current [UC Davis](http://ucdavis.edu/) postdoctoral fellow, [Lloyd Nackley](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lloyd-nackley/54/232/2b0), and two of my committee members at [UW](http://washington.edu/), Drs. [Kern Ewing](http://faculty.washington.edu/kern/) and [Soo-Hyung Kim](http://faculty.washington.edu/soohkim/)
