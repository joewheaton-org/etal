The ET-AL's [Alan Kasprak](http://alankasprak.org/), [Becca Rossi](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/rebecca-rossi), [Nick Bouwes](https://www.facebook.com/The-Island-Market-487992434589030/timeline/), [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org/) and the [USFS's Brett Roper](http://www.fs.fed.us/biology/nsaec/thecenter-staff.html) and I ([Nate Hough-Snee](http://natehough-snee.org/)) recently had our paper on models of instream wood in the interior Columbia River Basin, "Hydrogeomorphic and Biotic Drivers of Instream Wood Differ Across Sub-basins of the Columbia River Basin, USA," [published in *River Research Applications*](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.2968/abstract). This paper explores how climate and hydrologic and ecological settings differ between [CHaMP sub-basins](http://champmonitoring.org/) and how these settings correspond to different wood loads.
