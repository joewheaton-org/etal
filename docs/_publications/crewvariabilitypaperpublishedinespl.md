Sara Bangen, Joe Wheaton, Nick Bouwes, and others just published a paper examining the role of observer variability in ground-based topographic surveys of wadeable streams in Earth Surface Processes and Landforms (ESPL).  The paper used total station survey data from the Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program's ([CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org/)) 2011 pilot field season crew variability study where 7 crews surveyed the same 6 reaches in the Upper Grande Ronde River Basin, Oregon.
