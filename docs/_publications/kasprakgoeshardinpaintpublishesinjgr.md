[Alan Kasprak](http://www.alankasprak.org/) recently published a portion of his dissertation, "[The relationship between particle travel distance and channel morphology: Results from physical models of braided rivers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JF003310/abstract)" in the [Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface.](http://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/agu/jgr/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2169-9011/) This output was a part of Alan's flume work on understanding particle transport and settlement in braided river systems. It was undertaken in the summer of 2013, and completed at the University of Western Ontario in mountainous London, Ontario, Canada. Co-authors include Peter Ashmore, Sarah Peirce, [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org/) and [James Hensleigh.](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/james-hensleigh)
