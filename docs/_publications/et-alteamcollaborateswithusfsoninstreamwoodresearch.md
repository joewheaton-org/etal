FHC/ET-AL team members Alan Kasprak and I (Nate Hough-Snee) recently published our work on the direct and indirect drivers of wood in the Columbia and Missouri River Basins. The article ["Direct and indirect drivers of instream wood in the interior Pacific Northwest, USA: decoupling climate, vegetation, disturbance, and geomorphic setting"](http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/remc.2014.2.issue-1/remc-2014-0002/remc-2014-0002.xml) was published in Riparian Ecology and Conservation, a new open access journal on all things riparian, from ecology to geomorphology and hydrology. Co-authors on the project include Dr. Brett Roper (USFS - Fish and Aquatic Ecology Unit/USU) and Dr. Christy Meredith (PIBO EM).
