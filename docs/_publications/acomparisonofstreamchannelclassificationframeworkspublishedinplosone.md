Alan Kasprak and Nate Hough-Snee recently led a team of FHC researchers and research partners in an effort to compare stream classification networks within Oregon’s Middle Fork John Day River Basin. This much-anticipated research explores both the agreement and disagreement between the River Styles Framework, Rosgen Classification, Natural Channel Classification, and a statistical classification at a suite of CHaMP sites. The paper is available on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298476211_The_Blurred_Line_between_Form_and_Process_A_Comparison_of_Stream_Channel_Classification_Frameworks) or [PLOS ONE](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298476211_The_Blurred_Line_between_Form_and_Process_A_Comparison_of_Stream_Channel_Classification_Frameworks).
