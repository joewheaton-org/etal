The FHC and ET-AL's [Nate Hough-Snee](http://natehough-snee.org/), [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org/) and Ryan Lokteff (M.S. 2013) recently collaborated with the [Forest Service's Brett Roper](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fiTbfzsAAAAJ&hl=en) to publish a landscape-scale classification of riparian vegetation across the American interior Pacific Northwest. The study is currently in press at [River Research and Applications.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rra.2815/abstract) The study takes a hierarchical approach to assessing how riparian plant communities assemble in small, low-order streams of the Columbia and Missouri River basins. The study was undertaken when Hough-Snee and Lokteff worked for both the [USFS PIBO program](http://www.fs.fed.us/biology/fishecology/emp/) and the USU ET-AL and was made possible by funding from the USFS.
