Steve Bennett and Nick Bouwes just published a pair of important pair of papers in Fisheries this month highlighting the groups work on Intensively Monitored Watersheds (including Bridge Creek beaver restoration and Asotin Creek HDLWD restoration) and Adaptive Management in the Asotin Creek IMW.  There has been a fair amount of [positive press surrounding their publication](http://etal.joewheaton.org/et-al-news/news/businessinsiderpicksuponimwsandsteve) including an [Associated Press article](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-studies-examine-habitat-restoration-for-salmon-steelhead-2016-2) and this [USU Today piece](http://www.usu.edu/today/?id=55488).
