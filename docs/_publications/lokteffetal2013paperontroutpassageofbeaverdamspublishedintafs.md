This paper provides some solid empirical evidence about the role that beaver dams play in discouraging movement of non-native Brown trout, vs. apparently not impeding the movement of native Cutthroat trout. The work represents one of [Ryan Lokteff's](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/where-are-they-now/former-graduate-students/ryan-lokteff) chapter in his Masters Thesis, which he defended back in April.
