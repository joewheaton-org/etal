[The ET-AL's](http://etal.joewheaton.org/) [Nate Hough-Snee](http://natehough-snee.org/) and his former [UW](http://sefs.washington.edu/) colleague Rodney Pond have published their work assessing how soil amendment shapes forest restoration in North Cascades National Park, Washington State, USA. This note illustrates how soil amendment creates winners (survivors) and losers (dead trees) when using amendment to improve soil nutrition at heavily degraded sites. While growth increased in three species (Douglas fir, black cottonwood, and red alder) that received soil amendment,  a greater proportion of the trees that died were amended. Increased mortality in amended trees was attributed to water stress from transpiration required for the vigorous photosynthesis and canopy growth of amended trees and increased competition from neighboring trees. The paper ran in the [September issue of *Ecological Restoration*](http://er.uwpress.org/content/vol32/issue3/) and is also available from [Nate's Figshare](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1054810).
