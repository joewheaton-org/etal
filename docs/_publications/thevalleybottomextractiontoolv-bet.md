Our paper, "The Valley Bottom Extraction Tool (V-BET): a GIS tool for delineating valley bottoms across entire drainage networks" was recently published in the journal Computers & Geosciences.  The paper presents the V-BET tool, explains how it works and presents an application of valley bottom delineation for the state of Utah and several basins within the interior Columbia River Basin.
