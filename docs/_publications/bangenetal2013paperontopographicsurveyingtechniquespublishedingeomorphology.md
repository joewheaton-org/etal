This paper intercompares bare earth DEMs of wadeable stream topography derived from data collected using ground-based (total station, rtkGPS, LiDaR) and airborne (NIR LiDaR) surveying techniques.  Data was collected at six sites of varying complexity (e.g. slope, vegetation cover) to highlight under what conditions different techniques perform well and where they do not.  This research was a component of Sara Bangen's MS thesis which she worked on as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Ecogeomorphology & Topographic Analysis Lab and completed in the Spring of 2013.
