Back in 2015, Damia Vericat, James Brasington and Joe put together a chapter reviewing the morphological approach to estimating sediment transport from repeat topographic surveys. There was a surprising lack of examples in the literature of the method being used in the recent literature or high resolution topographic surveys being exploited for this purpose. We review the various ways the approach can be implemented and show some examples.
