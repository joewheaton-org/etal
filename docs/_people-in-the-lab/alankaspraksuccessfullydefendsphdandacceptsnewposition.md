ET-AL doctoral student Alan Kasprak successfully defended his dissertation earlier this year. He is now starting a two-year Mendenhall Postdoc Fellowship with the [USGS Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center](http://www.gcmrc.gov/) in Flagstaff, Arizona. In his new position, he will work with [Dan Buscombe](https://profile.usgs.gov/dbuscombe), [Paul Grams](https://profile.usgs.gov/pgrams), and [Joel Sankey](https://profile.usgs.gov/jsankey) to examine the relative roles of fluvial and aeolian sediment transport in valley bottom deposits along the Colorado River. Among his many new challenges, he will continue the use of landscape surveying using laser scanning and structure-from-motion along with digital elevation model differencing to better understand how sediment moves through the river valley at weekly to decadal timescales.
