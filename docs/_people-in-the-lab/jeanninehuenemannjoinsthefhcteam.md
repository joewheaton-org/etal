The Fluvial Habitats Center (FHC) welcomes Jeannine Huenemann to its illustrious ranks. Having haunted the hallowed halls of USU for many a year, she hails from the Midwest where her first real job was as a summer guide at a local nature center in Janesville, Wisconsin. She has called Utah home for nearly two decades, and enjoys an active life with her husband Charlie, two teenagers, Hana and Ben, and her faithful dog Maggie (pictured below). She will be helping with budgets, billing, and marketing. Being curious by nature, Jeannine looks forward to meeting everyone and finding out about the projects and funding that keeps FHC and ET-AL going.
