We're excited to welcome [Wally Macfarlane]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/researchers-technicians/Wally) to the lab. Wally brings with him a wealth of experience in GIS, photogrammetry and applied spatial research in ecology, conservation and geography. Wally was one of the co-founders of [Treefight.org](http://treefight.org/) and prior to coming to the lab as a Research Associate was instrumental in research revelaing the impacts of climate change on facilitating the massacare of white bark pine by beetles (see the [full NPR story here](http://www.npr.org/2010/12/26/126107761/small-beetles-massacre-the-rockies-whitebark-pines)). Wally will be working on a mix of projects split between our lab, the [Budy Fish Ecology Lab](http://www.usu.edu/fel/), the [Adler Lab](http://www.cnr.usu.edu/htm/facstaff/adler-web), and the [RS-GIS Lab](http://www.gis.usu.edu/).  To start, Wally is working for ET-AL on:

- [GCT: Pilot Study: Testing the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT)]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/past-projects/gct-pilot-study-testing-the-beaver-restoration-assessment-tool-brat)
- [NPS: Assessment of Indicator Sites & Quantifying Short-Term Effects of High Flows on Riparian Vegetation along the Yampa & Green Rivers]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/current-projects/nps-assessment-of-indicator-sites-quantifying-short-term-effects-of-high-flows-on-riparian-vegetation-along-the-yampa-green-rivers)
