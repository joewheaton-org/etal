With a recently completed Bachelor of Science in Wildlife Science from USU, Chalese now works with us as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technician. Most recently, she monitored brine shrimp and bird populations on the Great Salt Lake for Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR). Prior to working on our team, she was employed as a seasonal technician for one summer at Camp Williams. She also spent three summers monitoring big game habitat throughout Utah for the UDWR. Her [profile page](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/chalese-hafen) gives more details of her work.
