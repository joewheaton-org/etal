[Nate Hough-Snee](http://www.natehough-snee.org/) will officially be joining the ET-AL lab to pursue his PhD. Nate will be working on some aspect of beaver feedbacks and impacts on riparian ecology. Nate brings with him a wealth of experience in applied plant ecology and restoraiton ecology working in the Pacific Northwest.

From Nate's [natehough-snee.org](http://natehough-snee.org/) website, he describes himself as:

*'I am an applied plant ecologist and wetland scientist who works at the intersections of restoration ecology, plant ecophysiology and plant community ecology.  I am interested in how plant physiological and ecological processes are driven by variation in hydrology, soil resources and environmental stress and how these processes can inform the design of ecosystem restoration schemes.  I tend to look at these processes **in situ, in the greenhouse and through experimental field trials or through on-the-ground restoration. I have worked on degraded and restored wetlands, forests and novel ecosystems from New Zealand to Alaska with most of my work occurring in the American Pacific Northwest.*

*I earned my B.A. through the University of Washington's Program on the Environment and my M.S. through what is now the UW's School of Environmental and Forest Sciences within the College of the Environment. In the autumn of 2011, I joined the Department of Watershed Sciences at Utah State University where I am pursuing my PhD in ecology. In the spring of 2012, I joined the USDA Forest Service's PIBO effectiveness monitoring program.*

*Working at USU\* and the USFS\*, I examine how hydrologic variability, restoration and management feed back on plant community changes within semi-arid riparian and wetland environments.Call me a plant ecologist, restoration ecologist or wetland scientist, just don't call me late to dinner.'*
