Shane Hill has worked in the ET-AL Lab as a GIS and Research Technician for various projects, under the direction of Wally Macfarland. Shane did a great job, but is ready to move on. He is currently working as a wildlife technician for Dr. Dave Stoner, conducting herpetological studies at [Camp Williams](http://aec.army.mil/portals/3/newsroom/update/fall06/fall0614.html) near Bluffdale, Utah, and plans to go to grad school soon. We'll miss him and we wish him the best of luck.
