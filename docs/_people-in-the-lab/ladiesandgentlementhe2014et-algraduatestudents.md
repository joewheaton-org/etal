Fearless leader [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org/) (and yes, his face froze like that...forever), PhD Students [Nate Hough-Snee ](http://natehough-snee.org/)and [Alan Kasprak](http://alankasprak.org/), and M.S. students, [Martha Jensen](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/martha-jensen) and [Rebecca Rossi](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/rebecca-rossi). 

M.S. student [Reid Camp](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/reid-camp) was too busy shocking fish and making data collection apps to make an appearance for this photo opp.
