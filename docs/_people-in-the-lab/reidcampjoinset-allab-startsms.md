Reid Camp, who has been working for [Eco Logical Research, Inc.](http://ecologicalresearch.net/) an collaborating with ET-AL on the [Asotin Creek Intensively Monitored Watershed](http://etal.joewheaton.org/projects/current-projects/elr-asotin-lwd-restoration-and-imw) for the past four years has joined the ET-AL lab. Reid is starting his MS in Watershed Sciences Spring semester 2013. He has a BS from University of Idaho in Fisheries and extensive experience running both the fish sampling and habitat crews for the Asotin IMW.  Reid wants to round out his skill-set with formal training in fluvial geomorphology and hydrology. Reid has played a critical role in the restoration design and implementation and he will hit the ground running with a MS research project that focuses on working up findings and design hypothesis testing from the restoration experiments. We are excited to welcome him to Logan and benefit from his expertise here in the lab.
