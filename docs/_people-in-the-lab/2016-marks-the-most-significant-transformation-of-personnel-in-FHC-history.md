During 2016, graduate students Alan Kasprak and Nate Hough-Snee, researchers James Hensleigh, Elijah Portugal, and Kenny DeMeurichy and GIS Technician Taylor Dudunake moved on to further their careers ([where are they now]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/where-are-they-now)?) whereas Matthew Meier, Geoff Stevens, Micael Albonico, Adan Banda and Natalie Kramer Anderson joined the FHC ([People]({{ site.baseurl }}/people/researchers-technicians)). We extend our gratitude and best wishes to those who have moved on and a warm welcome to the new members of the FHC team. We are excited about our new team and are looking forward to all the great work we have planned for 2017 and beyond.
