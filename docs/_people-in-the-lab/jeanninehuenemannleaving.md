After working with the ET-AL staff for nearly a year as a business/marketing manager, she has recently joined USUâ€™s Ecology Center. She is now working on the [iUTAH](http://iutahepscor.org/) project as a communications specialist. We would like to thank Jeannine for helping with accounting, budgets, billing, and marketing during her time with us, and wish her the best of luck in all of her future endeavors. We will miss her.
