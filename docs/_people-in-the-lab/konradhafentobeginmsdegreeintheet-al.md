[Konrad Hafen,](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/konrad-hafen) [the undisputed champion undergraduate of the QCNR and USU](http://researchweek.usu.edu/2013/htm/undergraduate-research-day-april-11-2013/undergraduate-researchers-of-the-year/konrad-hafen/), is moving from his current position as a programmer/technician on the ET-AL's MORPHED and braided rivers projects into a master of science program with Joe Wheaton. Konrad has a B.S. in Wildlife Science from Utah State, and has been working closely with Alan Kasprak and Joe Wheaton. Congratulations to Konrad on the move into the graduate ranks - the ET-AL is lucky to retain yet another bright, young scientist!
