The Raft River beaver restoration, a [UDWR](http://wildlife.utah.gov/) and [USU FHC ](http://etal.joewheaton.org/)collaboration, was recently implemented by a combination of USU, UDWR, and [Utah Conservation Corps](http://www.usu.edu/ucc/) volunteers. Designed by Kent Sorenson, Joe Wheaton, and I ([Nate Hough-Snee](http://natehough-snee.org/)), the project was implemented this week and visited on its final implementation day by visiting Macquarie University professor, [Kirstie Fryirs](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/directory/listing/person.htm?id=kfryirs), and USU students Alex Walker, [Martha Jensen](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/martha-jensen), Sammy Lyster, Angus Vaughan, with direct project support from the FHC's [Elijah Portugal](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/elijah-portugal) and [Kenny DeMeurichy](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/kenny-demeurichy). The project will be monitored through 2016 to adaptively manage the project and assess future stream trajectories.
