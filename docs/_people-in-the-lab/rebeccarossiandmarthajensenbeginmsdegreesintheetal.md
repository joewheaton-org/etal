The ETAL welcomes [Rebecca Rossi](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/rebecca-rossi) and [Martha Jensen](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/martha-jensen), both of whom have joined the [Ecogeomorphology and Topographic Analysis Lab](http://etal.joewheaton.org/) at [Utah State University](http://usu.edu/) to pursue Masters degrees. 

Martha, a New Jersey native, is no stranger to USU and the ETAL, as she holds a BS in Environmental Studies, *Magna Cum Laude ,*from [USU's Quinney College of Natural Resources](http://cnr.usu.edu/) and recently worked in the ETAL to implement the statewide Utah [beaver restoration assessment tool](http://brat.joewheaton.org/) project. Martha is also single-handedly responsible for [making nearly every ETAL promotional material](http://etal.joewheaton.org/fhc-factsheets-posters). Ever. She will be working on stream restoration and watershed characterization in response to beaver introduction and other restoration activities.
