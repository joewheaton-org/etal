Having left Logan for the wilds of greener pastures, Pete has returned to work with a variety of modeling approaches (simulation and statistical) and ISEMP/CHaMP datasets. Pete was most recently working in the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand, where he was involved in riverine food webs, and a mix of fishery and population modeling, as a postdoc and government scientist. He maintains an active interest in broader themes within stream ecology and management, including studies that assess the relationships between the physical environment and fish populations, stream communities, and the structure of riverine food webs.
