The Fluvial Habitat Center (FHC) welcomes Joshua Gilbert to the team. Joshua recently received his B.S. degree in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences from Utah State University. During his studies, his areas of interest included the physical/hydrological processes that occur in aquatic ecosystems that have an effect on the fish present, and stream restoration in altered and degraded habitats. For now he will work at the FHC while he gains experience before pursuing graduate work. When not at work, Joshua can be found  fly fishing on area streams and rivers.
