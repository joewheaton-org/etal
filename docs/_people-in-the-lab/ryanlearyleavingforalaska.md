Ryan Leary joined the ET-AL Lab in September of 2011 to work on the [Idaho Power: TLS Data Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/past-projects/idaho-power-tls-data-analysis) project. Ryan did a great job, but has now finished his Masters of Natural Resources and is heading up to Alaska to take a job. We'll miss him and we wish him the best of luck.
