On Saturday January 23rd, Elijah Portugal from the FHC was interviewed again by Jennifer Pemberton from Utah Public Radio's excellent program on water issues in Utah, [The Source](http://upr.org/post/source-year-water-review). The short (~5 mins) follow up interview was in regards to the Walmart beaver mitigation project, where Elijah filled Jennifer in on the current developments at the Walmart beaver ponds since last April when the original interview was conducted. In summary, we successfully installed two pond levelers upstream of the two main beaver dams within the wetland area in Spet (2106) to control flooding, and the devices have been successfully working since then. We also used fencing and abrasive paint to prevent the unwanted harvest of ~6 trees. Many thanks again to Jennifer pemberton from The Source and everyone else that made this project a success!
