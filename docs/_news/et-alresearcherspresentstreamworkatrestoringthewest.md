The Fluvial Habitat Center and Ecogeomorphology and Topographic Analysis Lab presented numerous posters and talks at the recent Restoring the West conference on the Utah State campus. Wally MacFarlane, Martha Jensen, Alan Kasprak, Nick Bouwes, Elijah Portugal, Reid Camp, and I (Nate) all got the chance to present the lab's work in the Pacific Northwest, Colorado Plateau and beyond.

Joe Wheaton, and I (Nate) were fortunate to present our work with our academic, state and federal collaborators. It was a great two days of conversations, ideas and presentations and was made possible by the work and financial support of [Utah State University Forestry Extension](http://forestry.usu.edu/) and the [Utah State University Quinney College of Natural Resources](http://cnr.usu.edu/).  

The full conference archive and presentation videos can be found at: [restoringthewest.org](http://restoringthewest.org/)
