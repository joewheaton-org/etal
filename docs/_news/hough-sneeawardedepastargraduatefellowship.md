As hard as it was to write a third-person title about myself (at Joe's request), it's easier than answering questions on your science with the media for the first time. Mary-Ann Muffoletto, publicist and outreach specialist for USU's Quinney College of Natural Resources, was very professional and courteous as she interviewed me about my recent EPA STAR graduate fellowship that I was awarded for 2014-16. For the duration of the fellowship, I'll be modeling functional plant diversity in riparian zones of the American intermountain West and Pacific Northwest, trying to identify climatic and hydrologic thresholds in riparian ecosystem change. This work is being undertaken with numerous long-term data sets from the PACFISH/INFISH Biological Opinion, Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program, and USGS. My collaborators will include Brett Roper and Dave Merritt from the USFS, Mike Scott from the USGS and my dissertation committee (Nancy Huntly and Jim Lutz) at Utah State University.

Thanks to Mary-Ann for her ongoing coverage of our lab's work and the work coming out of QCNR!
