A recent publication in Logan's* Herald Journal - Bridgerland Edition* on June 28, 2015 featured our favorite furry friend. The article, titled ["As Busy as Beavers"](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=am9ld2hlYXRvbi5vcmd8ZXQtYWx8Z3g6MWQzOGFjNDM4M2MxMmZiZQ) was included in the* Wild Things* issue celebrating Cache Valley's living treasures. [Nick Bouwes](https://sites.google.com/a/ecologicalresearch.net/ecologicalreseach-net/home/our-staff/nick-bouwes-phd-owner) provided details on the work of the Fluvial Habitats Center, and projects between the south Walmart and the [Bear River Watershed Council](http://www.brwcouncil.org/). He also said that a recent count conducted on the Logan River and Blacksmith Fork draining areas found over 1,100 beaver dams.
