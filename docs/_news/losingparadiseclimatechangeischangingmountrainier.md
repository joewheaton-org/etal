After two field seasons at Mount Rainier National Park, et al. graduate student, Becca Rossi, is featured in the article/video for her research on avulsion channels in the Carbon River Valley (northwest side of the park), and an all park natural hazard inventory and vulnerability assessment. Her contributions have aided in understanding avulsion mechanisms and floodplain response and interaction with large woody debris within an old growth forest. Her efforts have also helped management teams at Mount Rainier evaluate road access and park infrastructure vulnerabilities in the event of future natural hazards.
