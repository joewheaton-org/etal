A team of ET-AL former and current graduate students ([Kasprak](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/where-are-they-now/former-graduate-students/alan-kasprak), [Hough-Snee](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/where-are-they-now/former-graduate-students/nate-hough-snee), [Camp](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/where-are-they-now/former-graduate-students/reid-camp) & [Jensen](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/students/martha-jensen)) decided to take a class project in a River Styles short course to compare various stream classification approaches to a whole new level. They published their findings in [PLOS-One](http://etal.joewheaton.org/et-al-news/new-fhc-et-al-or-elr-publications/acomparisonofstreamchannelclassificationframeworkspublishedinplosone) this week and [Utah Public Radio](http://upr.org/post/classification-systems-rivers-more-complementary-expected) and [USU Today](http://www.usu.edu/today/?id=55616) both picked up the story.

What is neat about this contribution is a team of USU WATS graduate students led an effort to bring together some of the worldÂ´s leading experts on issues of stream classification and river management who have been on very different sides of a sometimes hostile debate. These students managed to point out the common ground among the different perspectives and provide a constructive, and meaningful scientific contribution from some co-authors that I am sure most in our discipline would have never predicted would find a unified message, much less write a paper together. All this as an extra-curricular, side project spurred from a class they took together here at Utah State. Pretty cool.
