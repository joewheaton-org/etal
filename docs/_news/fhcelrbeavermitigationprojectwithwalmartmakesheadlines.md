The [FHC](http://etal.joewheaton.org/a/joewheaton.org/et-al/) , [ELR](http://ecologicalresearch.net/) , and Anabranch Solutions have been working for the past year with Dan Miller from the [Bear River Watershed Counci](http://www.brwcouncil.org/)l, to help the South Logan Walmart and the City of Logan develop an adaptive beaver management plan.  The plan by [Portugal et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283326474_Spring_Creek_Wetland_Area_Adaptive_Beaver_Management_Plan) (2015) is quite simple - instead of relying on traditional approaches of lethal control to mitigate the potential flooding and tree harvesting impacts of beaver, it proposes simple 'living with beaver' strategies.  The plan draws on long-standing techniques of 'living with beaver mitigation strategies' (e.g. [Beaver Solutions](http://beaversolutions.com/)), and codifies potential actions to different scenarios in to a simple, common sense approach to mitigating the nuisance problems beaver pose.

The efforts culminated on October 12 in the installation of a couple of pond levelers. Much to our surprise, this relatively small side project we undertook as a volunteer effort garnered significant [media attention](https://www.usu.edu/today/index.cfm?id=55215). Below is a partial listing of some of the media outlets that picked up the story. FHC's Nick Bouwes, Elijah Portugal and Scott Shahverdian are all featured.
