The [Grand Canyon Trust](http://www.grandcanyontrust.org/) has just released a new 13-minute video “Beaver: Back to the Future,” featuring ET AL's own [Nick Bouwes](https://qcnr.usu.edu/pages/the_college/directory/faculty-directory/bouwes_nicolaas). It also includes four Forest Service employees, and a retired Regional Forester who praise the power of beaver to beneficially restore and manage national forest water flows in the face of climate change.

Filmmaker Sarah Koenigsberg’s camera captures three processes by which beaver have recently been able to re-enter creek systems in Utah, Oregon, and Washington to work their dam magic.
