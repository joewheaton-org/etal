The ET-AL lab's [Nate Hough-Snee](http://natehough-snee.org/) recently brought home the bacon, winning a student research grant from the [Society of Wetland Scientists](http://www.sws.org/). Nate will use these funds to support his ongoing research that examines the ability of beaver dams to acts as buffers against erosion in flashy, arid streams.  Most importantly, the grant will support post-restoration geomorphic monitoring to better understand the annual-scale efficacy of beaver-assisted restoration projects.
