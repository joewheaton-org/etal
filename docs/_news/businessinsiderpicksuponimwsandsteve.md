An AP [article](http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-studies-examine-habitat-restoration-for-salmon-steelhead-2016-2) from Business Insider give a brief overview of salmon restoration work in the PNW. Specifically focusing on IMWs. Bridge Creek gets a mention, and [Steve Bennett ](http://etal.joewheaton.org/people/researchers-technicians/stephen-bennett)has a memorable quote:"It's OK if natural beavers join in on the fun," said Stephen Bennett, a research associate of watershed sciences at Utah State University who is involved with that and other studies." The article was in response to a pair of recent papers on [Intensively Managed Watersheds](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526653_Progress_and_Challenges_of_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_in_the_Pacific_Northwest_Using_Intensively_Monitored_Watersheds) and [Adaptive Management](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289526568_Adapting_Adaptive_Management_for_Testing_the_Effectiveness_of_Stream_Restoration_An_Intensively_Monitored) led by Steve Bennett and just published in last month's episode of Fisheries Magazine.
