Government and industry resource managers, restoration practitioners, and researchers attended a recent Geomorphic Change Detection workshop, in Logan, Utah on April 29 â€“ May 1.

Participants learned surveying techniques on the Logan River, as well as theory and tools behind geomorphic change detection from repeat topographic surveying and how to apply the [Geomorphic Change Detection software](http://gcd.joewheaton.org/) to their own monitoring data. 

The workshop was led by Dr. Joe Wheaton, along with Dr. Philip Bailey, of [North Arrow Research](http://www.northarrowresearch.com/), and James Hensleigh, Sara Bangen, and Kenny DeMeurichy, all of USU.

Future workshops are tentatively scheduled to be held in New Zealand, Spain, Lyon, France, and back in Logan, UT in April 2017. [See here for more details.](https://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/gcd_workshop/)
