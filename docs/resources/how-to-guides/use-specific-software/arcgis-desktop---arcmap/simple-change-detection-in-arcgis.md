title: Simple Change Detection in ArcGIS
---



In ArcGIS, it is simple to basic change detection between two raster surfaces using the [raster calculator](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisdesktop/10.0/help/index.html#/How_Raster_Calculator_works/009z000000z8000000/).
Here are some excerpts of simple exercises from a [change detection seminar](http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/Home/research/software/GCD/2010-nsf-lidar-workshop-materials) I ran at the[ NSF Sponsored Workshop](http://www.opentopography.org/index.php/blog/detail/workshop_announcement_new_tools_in_process_based_analysis_of_lidar_topograp) on "New Tools in Process-Based Analysis of Lidar Topographic Data":
