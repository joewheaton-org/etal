### Creating a Library From Scratch

In this video, I show you how to make a library from scratch, and four ways to populate that library with references: i) manually, ii) import from [Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com/), Journal homepage or [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) ,  iii) import from PDF , and iv) import from someone else's End Note Library [`*.enl file`](http://www.gis.usu.edu/~jwheaton/et_al/ICRRR/Beaver/Beaver_Bibliography.zip).

### Using Cite While you Write

You can use Cite While You Write in a word document, and it saves a portable EndNote library with the document. This allows you to share the word document with any collaborators and whether they have EndNote or not, they will be able to edit the document and see your citations. If they do have EndNote, they can add references from their own libraries to the paper. This video goes through the basic methods of using the EndNote Cite While You Write plugin for Word.
