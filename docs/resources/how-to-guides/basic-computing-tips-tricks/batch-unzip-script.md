In the lab we frequently deal with large datasets.  Whether getting data from an ftp or a collaborator, this data may come in a compressed (*.zip) folder.  If the data is in one or two *.zip folders then manually unzipping is the logical choice.  But when dealing with 10's to 100's to 1000's of compressed folders it's quite nice to have an automated approach.

Attached below is a simple and generic script for batch unzipping compressed folders.  A demo of the script can be found below.
