There are many great resources out there for writing scientific papers. Wally MacFarlane shared [this one](http://conservationbytes.com/2012/10/22/how-to-write-a-scientific-paper/) with our group form Conservation Bytes that has a really helpful step-by-step suggested workflow. One of the nice things about their suggested workflow is it focuses you on the narrative early on and only producing figures, tables and analyses that are necessary to tell that narrative.
