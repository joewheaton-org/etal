**Ecogeomorphology & Topographic Analysis Lab**

Welcome to the **E**cogeomorphology and **T**opographic **A**nalysis **L**ab, or et al. The ET-AL consists of a team of researchers comprising [Dr. Joe Wheaton's](http://joewheaton.org/) lab at [Utah State University](http://www.usu.edu/) in the [Department of Watershed Sciences](http://www.cnr.usu.edu/wats/). 

- The mission of the ET-AL is to illuminate and understand ecogeomorphic feedbacks and dynamics in rivers and streams through state-of-the art monitoring and modeling analyses.
- The majority of our research falls under the catch-all heading of [ecogeomorphology](http://sites.google.com/a/joewheaton.org/www/river-links/classification-schemes/eco-geo-hydro-mess). Geomorphic forms that cover the earth's surface can fundamentally be expressed as topography, and we are therefore concerned with the topographic representation of landscapes and physical habitat at various spatial scales. 
- The analyses we focus on are fundamental to better understanding fluvial environments in particular and their subsequent management and restoration.
- Much of our applied research is motivated by:
  - Helping develop better ways to **design and adaptively manage stream and river restoration projects** to allow these systems to be dynamic and self-sustaining. We are particularly interested in the next generation of '*cheap and cheerful*' restoration approaches (e.g. [partnering with beaver in restoration design](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/)).
  - Enabling people to better **monitor** the status and trends in rivers as well as the effectiveness of restoration interventions. We help agencies develop *hypothesis-driven monitoring programs* that leverage the latest technologies to increase efficiency. We blend intensive on the ground monitoring, with various rapid assessment strategies (ranging from drive-by & floats to overflights) and robust GIS desktop-based assessments to test our hypotheses in flexible and agile monitoring frameworks. 
- The Lab is equipped to conduct ground-based LiDaR, total station, GPS, and blimp photography surveys and has ample computing resources

Our graduate student team is based in the [Janet Quinney Lawson Building](http://www.usu.edu/map/index.cfm?id=47) (JQL 147) and the rest of our research team is based at the Fluvial Habitats Center in the in [Eccles Conference Center](http://www.usu.edu/map/index.cfm?id=19) (ECC 102) at Utah State University.
