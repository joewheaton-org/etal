**Project Location:** Hells Canyon, Snake River, ID
**Status:**   Completed

## Project Overview

### IPC Objective:

Idaho Power Co. (IPC) has collected and will continue to collect point cloud data on natural features and needs to develop improved, defensible ways of analyzing these data sets to evaluate changes in the surfaces through time. Dr. Wheaton has developed and is continuing to develop methods to evaluate point cloud data that may prove useful in IPCâ€™s work.
