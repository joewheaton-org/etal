<p>After a long walkabout to the Pacific Northwest and New Zealand, Pete returned to Logan in early 2015 in order to join the FHC team as a researcher. He currently works with a variety of modeling approaches (simulation and statistical) and ISEMP/CHaMP datasets to assess the benefits of habitat restoration activities aimed at recovering threatened steelhead and Chinook salmon populations within the interior Columbia Basin. When he’s not focused on freshwater habitat, Pete engages in the development and maintenance of models for planning mixed-stock ocean salmon fisheries under complex societal and conservation constraints. He also maintains an active interest in broader themes within stream ecology and management, including studies that assess the relationships between the physical environment and fish populations, stream communities, and the structure of riverine food webs. Beyond work, Pete enjoys running and hiking in the hills with his wife and dogs and is also an amateur coffee roaster and printmaking hack.</p>
