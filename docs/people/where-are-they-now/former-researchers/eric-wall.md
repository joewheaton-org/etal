Job Title: **Researcher**
Primary Affiliation: [Department of Watershed Sciences](http://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/)
Secondary Affiliation: [Fluvial Habitats Center](http://etal.joewheaton.org/)

### Education

- 2004 BS. Mathematics. James Madison University
- 2005 MAT. Middle and Secondary Education. James Madison University
- 2014 MS. Watershed Sciences. Utah State University

------

### Research

- My current research focuses on integrating hydraulic simulations and foraging models to estimate energetic profitability for drift-feeding fishes at various spatial scales.  With the help other FHC researchers and associates, I am also attempting to link energetic profitability predictions to the status and trend of fish populations.

### Bio

**Eric** is a researcher with the [Fluvial Habitats Center](http://etal.joewheaton.org/) at Utah State University.  He attended James Madison University to earn degrees in mathematics and education and previously taught middle and high school mathematics.  After teaching, Eric came to Utah State University to pursue his MS in watershed sciences.  He hopes to officially graduate in September, 2014.  Currently, Eric is working with other FHC researchers to model fish energetics at a variety of spatial scales.
