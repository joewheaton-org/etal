### Education

- 2017 BS (Will Graduate Spring 2017). Watershed & Earth Systems.     Minor - Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Utah State University

### Research

I am interested in research in the field of hydrology. With the addition of geospatial data and GIS, I hope to work with the State of Idaho and the Department of Water Resources to determine the current state Idaho's waterways are in. Although I'm only in my second year as an undergraduate student, I did participate in an undergraduate research group called the Bear River Fellows (Fall 2013-Spring 2014) under the supervision of Dr. David Rosenberg. We gathered and analyzed river flow data along a stretch of the Bear River in Northern Utah.
