### Currently:

In late 2014 Ryan became the [new Executive Director](http://www.skyhidailynews.com/news/14377826-113/lokteff-grand-county-gcwin) for the **Grant County Water Information Network** in Colorado. After graduating, Ryan worked for both the [USFS](http://www.fs.fed.us/biology/fishecology/emp/) and [BLM Bug Lab](http://www.usu.edu/buglab/) in Logan, Utah.

### Education

- 2001 Bachelor of Music. University of Idaho, Moscow, ID.
- 2007-2009 Geographic Information Systems courses. Shasta College, Redding, CA.

### Research

- Training in GIS and an appreciation for the outdoors have led me to combine abiotic conditions in aquatic systems with biotic components related to native and non native trout using various spatial analyses.  
- My graduate research is focused on the habitat use of native Bonneville cutthroat trout and invasive brown trout and brook trout in the Temple Fork watershed.  I am analyzing the physical aquatic environment using a combination of remote sensing tools such as ground based LiDAR, airborne LiDAR, total station, ArcPad, and aerial imagery.  I am exploring the behavior and biotic interactions of trout using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags and spawning surveys.  My goal is to understand the components of the biotic and abiotic factors in determining the habitat use of these three trout species.

### Bio

Ryan is a master's student with Joe Wheaton.  He graduated from the University of Idaho in 2001 with a Bachelor's degree in Music Education.  After seven years of teaching, Ryan retruned to school at USU to pursue a master's degree in watershed sciences.  In addition to academic life, Ryan works for the Forest Service under Brett Roper as a GIS and Biological Science technician in the PIBO effectiveness monitoring program.  In his spare time Ryan enjoys snowbaording, fishing, kayaking, hiking, skateboarding, and other outdoor activities.
