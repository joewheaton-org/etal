### Bio

**James Hensleigh** is a Geospatial Programmer/Analyst for the ET-AL at Utah State University. James earned his Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies from University of Utah in 2008. James then spent one year from 2010 to 2011 studying Geo-ecosystem Dynamics at Universiteit van Amsterdam while also working as a Research Assistant and GIS Analyst for the Institute for Environmental Studies at Vrije Universiteit. James recently completed his master's thesis "Geomorphic Change Detection using Multi-Beam SONAR". The core of this project is a synthesis of GIS and statistical analysis to develop an effective error model to quantify uncertainty involved in multi-beam SONAR surveys. Currently his main focuses are programming for [Geomorphic Change Detection software](http://gcd.joewheaton.org/), [CHaMP Topo Toolbar](https://sites.google.com/a/northarrowresearch.com/champtools/), and refining models of surface roughness for data obtained with multi-beam SONAR.
