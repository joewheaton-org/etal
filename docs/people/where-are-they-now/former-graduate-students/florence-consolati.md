### Research

- Florie's main interests are watershed restoration, fish ecology, beaver ecology and fluvial geomorphology.  Florie is interested in exploring ways that knowledge in these arenas can be applied to effectively restore our watersheds.


- Florie's research is exploring the role of beaver in shaping steelhead trout habitat complexity and thermal refugia for a restoration project under the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP), focused in the Intensively Monitored Watershed of Bridge Creek, in the John Day Basin of Central Oregon.  The restoration project has partnered with beaver to restore and incised stream and improve habitat for steelhead trout.

### Bio

Florie is currently a graduate research assistant in Dr. Joe Wheaton's ET-AL Lab at Utah State University. She joins us from the California Department of Fish and Game in Fortuna where she worked as the lead fisheries biologist for the Coastal Restoration Monitoring and Evaluation Program. At this position, Florie evaluated the effectiveness of over 80 watershed restoration projects throughout northern California. Florie earned her BS in Ecology with a Minor in Fisheries Biology from Humboldt State University in 2006. Since then, she also worked as a Fisheries Biological Technician for the USGS Cooperative Fisheries Research Unit of Humboldt State University, the AmeriCorps Watershed Stewards Project, and USFS Lassen National Forest.
