**Job Title:** Alumni

**Nate graduated in the fall of 2016 and now lives in the Wenatchee River Watershed, WA, USA, with his partner, Lexine, and Cedar, a red-heeler mix they treat like their child. He works on riparian and floodplain forest research and restoration across the North American West as co-owner of Meadow Run Environmental. When not coding in R, writing, moving, or breaking trekking poles, Nate is actively involved with the Society of Wetland Scientists, where he is a past president of the Pacific Northwest Chapter.**

### Bio

### 

**Nate **is a broadly trained riparian and restoration ecologist interested in riparian plant community responses to environmental variability and natural and anthropogenic disturbance. He is interested in assessing and using the relationships between hydrology, geomorphology, herbivory, and vegetation to design stream and wetland restoration schemes across western North America. Specifically, Nate is working to identify opportunities for the use of North American beaver (*Castor canadensis*) in restoring semi-arid streams of the American West. He is also broadly interested in ecoinformatics and how ecologists and natural resource managers can synthesize existing data to assess ecosystem integrity and future trajectories in response to global change.
