### Prospective Graduate Students

If you are interested in potentially working with Joe Wheaton at [Utah State University](http://qcnr.usu.edu/wats//), [contact him](https://joewheaton-org.github.io/joewheaton.org/contact) early in the process to discuss ideas. I've prepared a [prospective student page](https://joewheaton-org.github.io/joewheaton.org/students-teaching/graduate-students/information-for-prospective-graduate-students) which elaborates the application process, funding opportunities and what its like to live in Logan.
