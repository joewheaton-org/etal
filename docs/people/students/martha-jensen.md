### Research

- Examining the microhabitats of Bonneville cutthroat trout
- Investigating the consistency of bioenergetic model predictions in geomorphic units
- Helped develop techniques to spatially model the fluvial corridor and the riparian extent in the Colorado Plateau
- Helped develop and employ the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool ([BRAT](http://brat.riverscapes.xyz/)), to model beaver dam potential in Utah and Bridge Creek, Oregon 
- Interested in researching the effect of constructed wetlands on removing heavy metals from streams
- Interested in the positive feedbacks from beaver reintroductions; specifically to fish habitats and riparian corridors
- Interested in the role of mycorrhizal fungi within the riparian corridor
- Interested in using natural methods to restore streams

### Bio

Martha Jensen has a BS degree from Utah State University where her course work focused on GIS spatial analysis techniques and restoration ecology. Professionally, she has acted as a field manager on threatened and endangered native plant surveys, Superfund site monitoring and reporting, electro-fishing and macro-invertebrate sampling, and Environmental Site Assessments. Martha has also worked for the USU Fluvial Habitats Center on developing spatial analysis techniques and developing a cartographic standard for the lab. In August 2014, she began to pursue a Master's of Watershed Science degree with Dr. Joe Wheaton. She is examining the microhabitats of Boneville cutthroat trout and Net Rate Energy Intake model predictions. To complement her scientific research interests, Martha would like to develop techniques that could bridge the gap between art and science visualizing complex data sets, and increasing collaborations between artists and scientists.
