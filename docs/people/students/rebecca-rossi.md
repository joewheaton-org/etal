###             Bio

**Becca** Rossi joined the ET-AL lab as a research assistant in 2014. She received a B.S. (2013) in Earth Sciences and Archaeology at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Throughout her research at Dickinson, she became most interested in geomorphology, geologic mapping, and topographic analyses in GIS. After graduation, she interned as a geomorphology technician through the GeoCorps program at Mount Rainier National Park. The research focused on the Carbon River's response to climate-induced aggradation. Directly after Rainier, she worked on the Mauna Loa geologic mapping project at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the Big Island, where she experienced a primary volcanic landscape first hand. The following summer (2014), she returned to a familiar landscape, Mount Rainier, to continue geomorphology research and aid in GIS project support. In the ET-AL lab, she will research sandbar dynamics in Grand Canyon using emerging 'structure from motion' photogrammetry techniques.
