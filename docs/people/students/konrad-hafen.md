### Research

My research interests focus on watershed, fisheries, wildlife management, especially how spatial analysis and remote sensing can be applied to monitoring habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species. I am also interested in using existing data (or gathering data) to create large scale spatial models that can be applied to a variety of regions to inform management and planning decision. Currently,  I am working to model the ability of beaver dams to affect the storage and timing of spring runoff in the western United States where changing climatic regimes may have great influences on water delivery and availability.

### Bio

**Konrad Hafen**, graduated with a bachelor's degree from Utah State University in 2014 majoring in wildlife science with minors in GIS and fisheries science. His professional experience includes a variety of fish and wildlife monitoring, GIS and spatial analysis, and geospatial programming. Most recently Konrad worked as the primary developer of the [MoRPHED](https://github.com/morphed/MoRPHED) morphodynamic model with PhD student [Alan Kasprak](http://www.alankasprak.org/). His main interests include developing spatial models that can be used to inform management for different landscapes and species at various spatial scales.
