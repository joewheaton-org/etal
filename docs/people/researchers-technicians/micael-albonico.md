### Bio

Micael Albonico graduated in 2014 from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. He began working as an on-site geologist for a small geology company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was involved in several water well exploration projects, establishing brackish water wells. After the recess in oil prices, funding was no longer available for these water well projects, and he decided to look for a graduate program that would lead him into a different direction and out of the oil business. He moved to Logan, Utah in the hopes of finding a new path and to enjoy the outdoor thrills Utah has to offer. Currently, he is working as a GIS Technician in the FHC. At the FHC he has learned a great deal about fluvial geomorphology and watershed restoration.  

Outside of work and he enjoys being outside. He enjoys climbing, hiking, trail running, mountain biking, and snowboarding.
