### Research

Natalie’s research has focused on the physical processes along rivers with emphasis on in-stream wood. She enjoys multi-scale integrative research.  She is currently working on the [CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org/) project, integrating ecological and physical data throughout the headwaters of the Columbia Basin to aid in the recovery and management of salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.

### Bio

**Natalie Kramer **is a fluvial geomorphologist and lifelong river runner.  She joined the [ET-AL]({{site.baseurl}} team in January 2017 as a post-doctoral scholar after completing her PhD at Colorado State University with [Ellen Wohl](https://sites.warnercnr.colostate.edu/fluvial-geomorphology/people/34-2/) in 2016.  Natalie is a [SoGES Global Sustainability Leadership Fellow](http://sustainability.colostate.edu/slf-program) (2013) who values sharing her research with the general public.  She particularly enjoys telling compelling big picture stories about how riverine landscapes evolve and change through time. She has worked on a variety of projects resulting in numerous academic publications in respected journals.  Prior to working on data analysis and synthesis for [CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org/), most of her work was focused on the transport of instream wood through drainage networks and the legacy impacts of wood deposits on shorelines.  Kayaking has given her a broad intuitive understanding of rivers that has been hugely influential to her success as a physical scientist.  Fun fact: since infancy, Natalie has never gone a full year without floating down a river somewhere.
