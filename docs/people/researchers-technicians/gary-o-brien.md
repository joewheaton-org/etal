### Research

I am interested in the geomorphic and hydrologic processes that shape mountain, hillslope and riverine landscapes. Whole watersheds and their ecosystems adjust to cultural pressure and climatic change in styles that deserve careful study. My projects have focused on large desert rivers whose modern channel is modified by anthropogenic influence, and by climatic-driven fluctuations preserved in older records. I am motivated to understand drivers of environmental change on a variety of temporal and spatial scales.

### Bio

Gary O'Brien is a fluvial Geomorphologist who, over the past 20 years, has worked on several research projects related to modern rivers, and ancient alluvial and paludal records. In addition to varied field applications (geomorphic mapping and stratigraphic profiling, GPS and total station surveying, river navigation and airborne photography), he has overseen logistical and administrative aspects of large research projects, taught university courses and mentored students in the field. In addition to research in riverine environments, Gary has been a professional river guide on many western rivers including the Grand Canyon, and currently enjoys mountaineering, cycling, and aviation.

### Projects

- Coordinating and conducting resaerch on the refinement, continued development and implementation of Rapid Geomorphic Assessments for ISEMP basins, including River Styles analyses, on-the-ground surveys and Aerial overflights.
