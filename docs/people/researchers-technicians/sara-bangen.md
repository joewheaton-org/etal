Job Title: **Researcher - Fluvial Habitat Analyst**
Primary Affiliation: [Department of Watershed Sciences](http://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/)
Secondary Affiliation: [Ecogeomorphology & Topographic Analysis Lab]({{ site.baseurl }})

### Education

- 2006 BS. Environmental Science & Geography. University of Oregon, Eugene, OR.
- 2013 MS. Watershed Sciences. Utah State University, Logan, UT.

------

### Research

- General interests are in fluvial geomorphology, watershed processes, fish ecology, land use politics and how all of these elements interplay in the riverine systems of the West.
- Current research is focused on [CHaMP](https://www.champmonitoring.org/)protocol development and deriving geomorphic units that are indicative of stream processes from topography (e.g. DEMs).
- Graduate research was focused on: i) intercomparing the relative accuracy, precision and efficiency of using newer and established ground-based (e.g. total station, rtkGPS, terrestrial laser scanner) and airborne (e.g. LiDaR) surveying technologies to describe wadeable streambed and near-channel topography, and ii) quantifying the effect of observer variability on ground-based total station surveys.  Through these two studies we were able to provide valuable information related to the feasibility of applying  these technologies at the scale of large watershed habitat monitoring programs.

### Bio

**Sara** is a researcher in the ET-AL lab at Utah State University.  She graduated in  in 2006 from University of Oregon with a BS in Environmental Science and Geography. Since completing her undergraduate degree she has worked for several Columbia River Basin  instream habitat monitoring programs including NOAA's Integrated Status and Effectiveness Monitoring Program (ISEMP) and the United States Forest Service Pacfish/Infish Biological Opinion Monitoring Program (PIBO-EMP).  As well, Sara spent a year interning with the California Department of Fish and Game on the Northern California coast as an AmeriCorps Watershed Stewards Project (WSP) member.  She did her Masters in the ET-AL lab and defended in late 2012. She is staying on to continue working on CHaMP protocol development, development of topographically derived instream habitat units and the next generation of habitat metrics.

### Current Projects

- Developing a semi-automated approach to classify geomorphic units from topography
- Using traditional suitability curve and fuzzy approaches to model salmon habitat quality in the Columbia River basin
- Creating a more robust fuzzy inference system error model for DEMs derived from TS and rtkGPS surveys of wadeable stream and rivers 

### Past Projects
