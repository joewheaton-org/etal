### Bio

**Stephen** has worked in Canada and the USA as a consulting fish and wildlife biologist since 1990. After completing his PhD at Utah State in 2007 he began working with Eco Logical Research, Inc. as the project manager of the Asotin Creek Intensively Monitored Watershed Project in southeast Washington. Stephen has also worked to aid in the development and assessment of regional salmonid monitoring programs as a Post Doctoral researcher with Dr. Brett Roper of the USDA Forest Service, Fish and Aquatic Ecology Unit. Stephen’s Post Doctoral research focused on writing a National Forest Fish Inventory and Monitoring Manual for the Forest Service involving a comprehensive review of the statistical design and analyses of fish abundance data. Stephen’s dissertation focused on invasion ecology and issues related to hybridization between native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow trout. Prior to starting his PhD Stephen was a biological consultant for 12 years working on a variety of fisheries and wildlife issues including fish inventory, fish passage assessment, watershed analysis, habitat monitoring, impact assessments, and salmonid enhancement projects. In May 2013, Stephen was hired as a Researcher Lead for the Fluvial Habitats group at Utah State University which is a collaborative effort between the labs of Dr. Joe Wheaton and Dr. Nicolaas Bouwes.
